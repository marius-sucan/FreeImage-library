What is FreeImage ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FreeImage is an Open Source library project for developers who would like to support popular graphics image formats like PNG, BMP, JPEG, TIFF and others as needed by today's multimedia applications.

FreeImage is easy to use, fast, multithreading safe, and cross-platform (works with Windows, Linux and Mac OS X).

Thanks to it's ANSI C interface, FreeImage is usable in many languages including C, C++, VB, C#, Delphi, Java and also in common scripting languages such as Perl, Python, PHP, TCL, Lua or Ruby.

The library comes in two versions: a binary DLL distribution that can be linked against any WIN32/WIN64 C/C++ compiler and a source distribution.
Workspace files for Microsoft Visual Studio provided, as well as makefiles for Linux, Mac OS X and other systems.

This branch of the repository is used to compile the FreeImage.DLL used in Quick Picto Viewer. It brings the following changes:

Fixes:

- applied fixes found in the Fedora F39 repository for: CVE-2020-24292, CVE-2020-24293, CVE-2020-24295, CVE-2021-33367, CVE-2021-40263, CVE-2021-40266, CVE-2023-47995 and CVE-2023-47997 found at: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/freeimage/tree/f39 ;
- fixed buffer overflows in PluginICO.cpp, PSDParser.cpp, PluginTIFF.cpp (with the aforementioned patches)
- fixed jxr encoder to be able to handle images over 1300 mgpx;
- fixed bmp decoder/encoder to be able to handle images over 1300 mgpx;
- fixed behavior with extreme values of the tone-mapping algorithms; 
- fixed out of bounds accesses in PluginBMP, PluginPSD, PluginMNG and PluginPICT;
- fixed integer wrap around and segmentation fault in Exif.cpp;
- fixed FreeImage_Copy() to not crash with very large images [over 5000 mgpx];
- fixed FreeImage_Rescale() to work with very large images [over 5000 mgpx]; it no longer screws up the colors;
- fixed FreeImage_Rotate() to work with very large images [over 5000 mgpx];
- fixed a data race in the 1-bit 90/180/270 rotation;
- fixed the bundled ZLib, OpenEXR, LibJXR failing to compile on GCC 14+;
- fixed the GIF plugin: multi-page saves now enlarge the logical screen to fit every frame, and fixed a stack buffer overflow in the LZW encoder and a heap buffer overflow when loading such files with GIF_PLAYBACK;
- fixed the RAW plugin not reading a stream that does not start at byte zero;
- fixed the RAW plugin's datastream returning the wrong byte on a big-endian machine. LibRaw_freeimage_datastream::get_char() read one byte into an int and returned the int;
- fixed the G3 plugin hanging on a damaged fax file;
- fixed FreeImage_LockPage() getting slower the further into an animated GIF it went; reading an n-frame file from beginning to end cost O(n^2);
- fixed every multi-page document being parsed twice over, once to count its pages and again to read them;
- fixed Makefile.srcs / fipMakefile.srcs omitting tif_hash_set.c, which left libfreeimage.so with undefined TIFFHashSet* symbols;
- fixed loading from a stream that does not start at byte zero in the SGI, TGA, PICT, TIFF, EXR, JXR, MNG and JNG plugins and in multi-page documents opened from a handle or memory; TIFF, EXR, JXR and TGA also save correctly there;
- fixed 8-bit greyscale and palette TIFFs without a SamplesPerPixel tag failing to load, such as every one Pillow writes, and palette colours one level too dark;
- fixed TIFF IPTC metadata being cut to a quarter on save and read past its buffer on load; big-endian TIFFs with IPTC crashed;
- fixed CMYK PSD files loading and saving with the black channel reversed, and a bad PSD thumbnail failing or crashing the whole load;
- fixed PCX, TGA and PSD files that are short or damaged allocating gigabytes or showing uninitialised memory; uncompressed and odd-width 16-colour PCX decoding wrongly;
- fixed a double free in the PNG loader on a damaged end of file, a heap overflow in 16-bit RLE PSD saves, and memory leaks in PSD saves;
- fixed 8-bit ICO images with a short palette decoding with wrong colours and random ICO_MAKEALPHA alpha;
- fixed BMP RLE saves writing uninitialised heap memory into the file, 32-bit float PSD saves that could not be read back, and a crash when saving a multi-page document opened with FIF_LOAD_NOPIXELS;
- and many other fixes

Changes:
- FreeImage_FillBackground(), FreeImage_AllocateEx() and FreeImage_EnlargeCanvas() accept the option FI_COLOR_SET_ALPHA (0x08): nothing is blended and a 32-bit image gets the colour's alpha. FreeImage_FillBackground() keeps the three parameters of FreeImage 3.18;
- the TGA, XPM, PNG, ICO, J2K, JP2, BMP, PSD and TIFF writers return FALSE for image types and bit depths they do not declare instead of writing garbage; a FIT_INT16 image must now be converted before it is saved as PNG;
- a PNG that is cut short or damaged now loads with what was decoded instead of failing: every row decoded so far, an interlaced image at lower detail, the rest blank; a warning message, mirrored to DebugView, says what was kept;
- JPEG 2000 decoding uses one thread per 2 KiB of compressed data per tile, and none for small tiles, where more threads were slower;
- multi-threaded image resizer and rotation using OpenMP pragma; the makefiles now enable OpenMP too. Build it with `make OPENMP=0` for a single-threaded library; see README.linux;
- FreeImage_OutputMessageProc() mirrors every message to the debugger output (Sysinternals DebugView, the Visual Studio output window) as "qpv: fim: [FORMAT] message";
- FreeImage_CloseMultiBitmap() returns FALSE when a document opened with read_only=0 was changed in a format that has no writer, such as AVIF or HEIF, and leaves the file as it was; an unchanged document closes with TRUE;
- added FreeImage_OpenMultiBitmapU(), which takes a wchar_t for the file name and path;
- added FreeImage_AppendPageEx(), FreeImage_InsertPageEx(), FreeImage_RemovePageEx(), which return TRUE or FALSE;
- added FreeImage_RescaleRawBits();
- added full support for animated WebP files and example file; save WebP animations implemented as well;
- added AVIF loading (FIF_AVIF=37) with the bundled libavif 1.4.2 and dav1d 1.5.4;
- added HEIC/HEIF loading (FIF_HEIF=38, extensions heic/heif/hif) with the bundled libheif 1.23.4 and libde265 1.1.3; 
- added animated HEIC/HEIF reading (HEIF image sequences);
- added APNG reading and writing (FIF_APNG=39, extensions apng/png) on top of LibPNG; save APNG animations implemented as well;
- added full support for MNG animations (FIF_MNG=6), reader and write;
- updated LibRaw library to version 0.22.2, from 0.21.1;
- updated LibJPEG library to version 10, from the 9d of January 2020;
- updated LibTIFF library to version 4.7.2, from 4.6.0 release of September 2023;
- updated ZLib library to version 1.3.2, from the 1.2.13 of October 2022;
- updated OpenEXR library to version 3.3.14, from version 2.2.0. OpenEXR no longer uses ZLib for EXR data since 3.2. ZIP and DWA compression modes use libdeflate;
- updated OpenJPEG library to version 2.5.4, from a March 2014 trunk snapshot labelled 2.0.0;

Bugs or limitations identified:
- saving WEBP files is extremely slow at 16000 x 16000 px;
- creating multi-paged TIFFs causes crashes under certain circumstances;
- images over 5000 mgpx saved as JXR might be malformed; only Freeimage opens them correctly; Windows Photo opens them [on Win10], but without an alpha channel; Affinity Photo 2.0 and paint.net v5.0 crash on open;
